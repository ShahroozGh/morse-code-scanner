# initialize r16, r17, & r18 to 0 before calling this function for the first time; do not overwrite
# allocate space in memory for the morse sequence. Initialize r5 to point to this mem addr (and pass it as a param)

# explanation of the (relative) timing convention:
# all element lengths are integer (a) multiples of the dot
# 0x0 Dot  			= x 		
# 0x1 Dash 			= 3x 		a dot/dash is an "element"
# 0xD Element pause 		= x		there must be a break of length (x) between dots/dashes
# 0xE Char pause 		= 3x		go to next character; done with current char
# 0xF Word pause (space) 	= 7x		blank white space; done with current word

# (absolute) timing convention
# WPM = 1.2 * ( 1 / x ); 		1 / x = frequency
# at WPM = 10, x = 0.12 s
# at WPM = 15, x = 0.08 s

# at a sample rate of 100 Hz, there must be ( a * x * 100 ) - 1 consecutive hits to qualify as an element
# for example, at WPM = 15 -> x = 0.08s -> there must be ( 3 * 0.08 * 100 ) - 1 = 23 consecutive hits to qualify as a dash

# AS OF THE FIRST REVISION, QUITE A FEW VALUES ARE HARD-CODED. THIS MAY NOT BE IDEAL AND WILL BE REVISED

# LOGIC:

# function takes in a "boolean" value - is the sensor detecting an input above the threshold, or not - in r4
morseParse:

# by default, assume WPM = 15 -> x = 0.08 -> x * 100 = 8.  Maybe implement WPM settings based on switches?
# store x * 100 in r5 (or fetch from memory maybe?)
# movi r5, 0x8 - NOT CURRENTLY USED

# mask the LSB (boolean bit) of r4 - referred to as a *this* "sample" from here on
andi r6, r4, 0x1

# use r16 to save whether the *previous* sample was a hit/miss (hit = 1 = above threshold, miss = 0 = below threshold)

# if ( *this* sample == *previous* sample ), jump to increment logic

# else reset r17 & r18, and since the sequence has been broken, check for an element
